    <h3>Ariana Grande's Lyric Video</h3>
    <p>In Ariana Grande's “One More Time”, the narrator (Ariana) plays the role of someone in a broken romance,<br> and admittedly it is ‘her fault’. In other words, she lied to her ex. How exactly she deceived him is never specified.<br> However, the implication is that she cheated on him.
         And now she is reeling as a result of their breakup since he holds a very-special place in her heart.</p>
